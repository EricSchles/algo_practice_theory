# The Theory And Practice Of Algorithms

In this small tretise I will go over the theory and practice of algorithms.  This book is comprised of two parts - the implementation of various algorithms and run time model of the algorithm.  In the first part of the book, I will simply implement each algorithm and present 4 to 5 examples of how to use the algorithm in practice to solve a 'real world' problem.  The second part of the book, I will introduce a number of techniques for modeling the running time of algorithms and then I will analyze all the algorithms from part one.  

It is assumed that you, the reader, already know how to program.  If you do not, there are a number of great courses on learning how to code.  That is not the goal or intent of this book.  No treatment will be given to any programming technique, only the algorithms that can be built upon these programming techniques.
